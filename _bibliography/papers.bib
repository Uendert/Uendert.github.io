     abstract = "{In the era of precision cosmology, ensuring the integrity of data
        analysis through blinding techniques is paramount -- a challenge
        particularly relevant for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
        Instrument (DESI). DESI represents a monumental effort to map
        the cosmic web, with the goal to measure the redshifts of tens
        of millions of galaxies and quasars. Given the data volume and
        the impact of the findings, the potential for confirmation bias
        poses a significant challenge. To address this, we implement and
        validate a comprehensive blind analysis strategy for DESI Data
        Release 1 (DR1), tailored to the specific observables DESI is
        most sensitive to: Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO),
        Redshift-Space Distortion (RSD) and primordial non-Gaussianities
        (PNG). We carry out the blinding at the catalog level,
        implementing shifts in the redshifts of the observed galaxies to
        blind for BAO and RSD signals and weights to blind for PNG
        through a scale-dependent bias. We validate the blinding
        technique on mocks, as well as on data by applying a second
        blinding layer to perform a battery of sanity checks. We find
        that the blinding strategy alters the data vector in a
        controlled way such that the BAO and RSD analysis choices do not
        need any modification before and after unblinding. The
        successful validation of the blinding strategy paves the way for
        the unblinded DESI DR1 analysis, alongside future blind analyses
        with DESI and other surveys.}",

        measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) to constrain
        the expansion history of the Universe and set stringent
        constraints on dark energy. Therefore, precise control of the
        global error budget due to various systematic effects is
        required for the DESI 2024 BAO analysis. In this work, we focus
        on the robustness of the BAO analysis against the Halo
        Occupation Distribution (HOD) modeling for the Emission Line
        Galaxy (ELG) tracer. Based on a common dark matter simulation,
        our analysis relies on HOD mocks tuned to early DESI data,
        namely the One-Percent survey data. To build the mocks, we use
        several HOD models for the ELG tracer as well as extensions to
        the baseline HOD models. Among these extensions, we consider
        distinct recipes for galactic conformity and assembly bias. We
        perform two independent analyses in the Fourier space and in the
        configuration space. We recover the BAO signal from two-point
        measurements after performing reconstruction on our mocks.
        Additionally, we also apply the control variates technique to
        reduce sample variance noise. Our BAO analysis can recover the
        isotropic BAO parameter $\alpha_\text{iso}$ within
        0.1\textbackslash\% and the Alcock Paczynski parameter
        $\alpha_\text{AP}$ within 0.3\textbackslash\%. Overall, we find
        that our systematic error due to the HOD dependence is below
        0.17\textbackslash\%, with the Fourier space analysis being more
        robust against the HOD systematics. We conclude that our
        analysis pipeline is robust enough against the HOD systematics
        for the ELG tracer in the DESI 2024 BAO analysis.}",

        Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 analysis. This paper
        focuses on the study of HOD systematics for luminous red
        galaxies (LRG). We consider three different HOD models for LRGs,
        including the base 5-parameter vanilla model and two extensions
        to it, that we refer to as baseline and extended models. The
        baseline model is described by the 5 vanilla HOD parameters, an
        incompleteness factor and a velocity bias parameter, whereas the
        extended one also includes a galaxy assembly bias and a
        satellite profile parameter. We utilize the 25 dark matter
        simulations available in the AbacusSummit simulation suite at
        $z=$ 0.8 and generate mock catalogs for our different HOD
        models. To test the impact of the HOD modeling in the position
        of the BAO peak, we run BAO fits for all these sets of
        simulations and compare the best-fit BAO-scaling parameters
        $\alpha_{\rm iso}$ and $\alpha_{\rm AP}$ between every pair of
        HOD models. We do this for both Fourier and configuration spaces
        independently, using post-reconstruction measurements. We find a
        3.3$\sigma$ detection of HOD systematic for $\alpha_{\rm AP}$ in
        configuration space with an amplitude of 0.19\%. For the other
        cases, we did not find a 3$\sigma$ detection, and we decided to
        compute a conservative estimation of the systematic using the
        ensemble of shifts between all pairs of HOD models. By doing
        this, we quote a systematic with an amplitude of 0.07\% in
        $\alpha_{\rm iso}$ for both Fourier and configuration spaces;
        and of 0.09\% in $\alpha_{\rm AP}$ for Fourier space.}",

     abstract = "{We present cosmological results from the measurement of baryon acoustic
        oscillations (BAO) in galaxy, quasar and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest
        tracers from the first year of observations from the Dark Energy
        Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), to be released in the DESI Data
        Release 1. DESI BAO provide robust measurements of the
        transverse comoving distance and Hubble rate, or their
        combination, relative to the sound horizon, in seven redshift
        bins from over 6 million extragalactic objects in the redshift
        range $0.1<z<4.2$. DESI BAO data alone are consistent with the
        standard flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model with a matter
        density $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.295\pm 0.015$. Paired with a BBN
        prior and the robustly measured acoustic angular scale from the
        CMB, DESI requires $H_0=(68.52\pm0.62)$ km/s/Mpc. In conjunction
        with CMB anisotropies from Planck and CMB lensing data from
        Planck and ACT, we find $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.307\pm 0.005$ and
        $H_0=(67.97\pm0.38)$ km/s/Mpc. Extending the baseline model with
        a constant dark energy equation of state parameter $w$, DESI BAO
        alone require $w=-0.99^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$. In models with a time-
        varying dark energy equation of state parametrized by $w_0$ and
        $w_a$, combinations of DESI with CMB or with
        SN\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeIa individually prefer
        $w_0>-1$ and $w_a<0$. This preference is 2.6$\sigma$ for the
        DESI+CMB combination, and persists or grows when
        SN\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeIa are added in, giving
        results discrepant with the $\Lambda$CDM model at the
        $2.5\sigma$, $3.5\sigma$ or $3.9\sigma$ levels for the addition
        of Pantheon+, Union3, or DES-SN5YR datasets respectively. For
        the flat $\Lambda$CDM model with the sum of neutrino mass $\sum
        m_\nu$ free, combining the DESI and CMB data yields an upper
        limit $\sum m_\nu < 0.072$ $(0.113)$ eV at 95\% confidence for a
        $\sum m_\nu>0$ $(\sum m_\nu>0.059)$ eV prior. These neutrino-
        mass constraints are substantially relaxed in models beyond
        $\Lambda$CDM. [Abridged.]}",

        (BAO) measurements using over 5.7 million unique galaxy and

        we utilize 300,017 galaxies from the magnitude-limited Bright
        Galaxy Survey with 0.1<z<0.4, 2,138,600 Luminous Red Galaxies
        with 0.4<z<1.1, 2,432,022 Emission Line Galaxies with 0.8<z<1.6,

        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde7,500 square degree footprint.
        The analysis was blinded at the catalog-level to avoid
        confirmation bias. All fiducial choices of the BAO fitting and
        reconstruction methodology, as well as the size of the
        systematic errors, were determined on the basis of the tests
        with mock catalogs and the blinded data catalogs. We present
        several improvements to the BAO analysis pipeline, including
        enhancing the BAO fitting and reconstruction methods in a more
        physically-motivated direction, and also present results using
        combinations of tracers. We present a re-analysis of SDSS BOSS
        and eBOSS results applying the improved DESI methodology and
        find scatter consistent with the level of the quoted SDSS
        theoretical systematic uncertainties. With the total effective
        survey volume of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 18 Gpc$^3$,
        the combined precision of the BAO measurements across the six
        different redshift bins is
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.52\%, marking a 1.2-fold
        improvement over the previous state-of-the-art results using
        only first-year data. We detect the BAO in all of these six
        redshift bins. The highest significance of BAO detection is
        $9.1\sigma$ at the effective redshift of 0.93, with a constraint
        of 0.86\% placed on the BAO scale. We find our measurements are
        systematically larger than the prediction of Planck-2018 LCDM
        model at z<0.8. We translate the results into transverse
        comoving distance and radial Hubble distance measurements, which

        Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) is carried out within the upcoming
        Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's (DESI) 2024 results using
        its DR1 dataset, and the associated systematic error budget from
        theory and modelling of the BAO. We derive new results showing
        how non-linearities in the clustering of galaxies can cause
        potential biases in measurements of the isotropic
        ($\alpha_{\mathrm{iso}}$) and anisotropic
        ($\alpha_{\mathrm{ap}}$) BAO distance scales, and how these can
        be effectively removed with an appropriate choice of
        reconstruction algorithm. We then demonstrate how theory leads
        to a clear choice for how to model the BAO and develop,
        implement and validate a new model for the remaining smooth-
        broadband (i.e., without BAO) component of the galaxy
        clustering. Finally, we explore the impact of all remaining
        modelling choices on the BAO constraints from DESI using a suite
        of high-precision simulations, arriving at a set of best-
        practices for DESI BAO fits, and an associated theory and
        modelling systematic error. Overall, our results demonstrate the
        remarkable robustness of the BAO to all our modelling choices
        and motivate a combined theory and modelling systematic error
        contribution to the post-reconstruction DESI BAO measurements of
        no more than $0.1\%$ ($0.2\%$) for its isotropic (anisotropic)
        distance measurements. We expect the theory and best-practices
        laid out to here to be applicable to other BAO experiments in
        the era of DESI and beyond.}",

        challenges in cosmology. One of the proposed solutions to this
        problem is the modification of gravity on large scales. In this
        paper, we explore the well-known
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}-{\ensuremath{\Sigma}} parametrization
        scenarios and confront them with observational data, including
        the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation from the
        Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), Atacama Cosmology
        Telescope (ACT), and South Pole Telescope (SPT), as well as
        large-scale structure data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
        (SDSS; baryon acoustic oscillation + redshift-space distortion)
        and Pantheon supernova (SN) catalogue. We employ a Bayesian
        framework to constrain the model parameters and discuss the
        implications of our results on the viability of modified gravity
        theories. Our analysis reveals the strengths and limitations of
        the {\ensuremath{\mu}}-{\ensuremath{\Sigma}} parametrization and
        provides valuable insights into the nature of gravity on
        cosmological scales. From the joint analysis of the ACT + WMAP +
        SDSS + SN, we find {\ensuremath{\mu}}$_{0}$ - 1 = 0.02
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.19 and {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{0}$ - 1 =
        0.021 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.068 at 68 per cent confidence level
        (CL). In light of the SPT + WMAP + SDSS + SN, we find
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}$_{0}$ - 1 = 0.07 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.18 and
        $\Sigma _0 -1 = -0.009^{+0.078}_{-0.11}$ at 68 per cent CL. In
        all the analyses carried out, we do not find any deviations from
        the theory of general relativity. Our results represent an
        observational update on the well-known
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}-{\ensuremath{\Sigma}} parametrization in view
        of current CMB data, independent of and competitive with the

        find that the LRGs exhibit an angular scale of homogeneity

        cosmological models by comparing constraints on the geometry of
        the expansion history to those on the growth of structure.
        Specifically, we split the total matter energy density,
        {\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{ M }$, and (for wCDM) dark energy
        equation of state, w, into two parameters each: one that
        captures the geometry, and another that captures the growth. We
        constrain our split models using current cosmological data,
        including type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations,
        redshift space distortions, gravitational lensing, and cosmic
        microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. We focus on two tasks:
        (i) constraining deviations from the standard model, captured by
        the parameters {\ensuremath{\Delta}}{\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{ M
        }$ {\ensuremath{\equiv}} {\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{ M }$
        $^{grow}$-{\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{ M }$ $^{geom}$ and
        {\ensuremath{\Delta}}w {\ensuremath{\equiv}} w $^{grow}$-w
        $^{geom}$, and (ii) investigating whether the S $_{8}$ tension
        between the CMB and weak lensing can be translated into a
        tension between geometry and growth, i.e.
        {\ensuremath{\Delta}}{\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{ M }$
        {\ensuremath{\neq}} 0, {\ensuremath{\Delta}}w
        {\ensuremath{\neq}} 0. In both the split
        {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM and wCDM cases, our results from
        combining all data are consistent with
        {\ensuremath{\Delta}}{\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{ M }$ = 0 and
        {\ensuremath{\Delta}} w = 0. If we omit BAO/RSD data and
        constrain the split wCDM cosmology, we find the data prefers
        {\ensuremath{\Delta}}w < 0 at 3.6{\ensuremath{\sigma}}
        significance and {\ensuremath{\Delta}}{\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{ M
        }$ > 0 at 4.2{\ensuremath{\sigma}} evidence. We also find that
        for both CMB and weak lensing,
        {\ensuremath{\Delta}}{\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{ M }$ and S $_{8}$
        are correlated, with CMB showing a slightly stronger
        correlation. The general broadening of the contours in our
        extended model does alleviate the S $_{8}$ tension, but the
        allowed nonzero values of
        {\ensuremath{\Delta}}{\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{ M }$ do not
        encompass the S $_{8}$ values that would point toward a mismatch
        between geometry and growth as the origin of the tension.}",

        sky with a unique set of 56 filters using the dedicated 2.55 m
        Javalambre Survey Telescope (JST) at the Javalambre
        Astrophysical Observatory. Prior to the installation of the main
        camera (4.2 deg$^{2}$ field-of-view with 1.2 Gpixels), the JST
        was equipped with the JPAS-Pathfinder, a one CCD camera with a
        0.3 deg$^{2}$ field-of-view and plate scale of 0.23 arcsec
        pixel$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$. To demonstrate the scientific
        potential of J-PAS, the JPAS-Pathfinder camera was used to
        perform miniJPAS, a {\ensuremath{\sim}}1 deg$^{2}$ survey of the
        AEGIS field (along the Extended Groth Strip). The field was
        observed with the 56 J-PAS filters, which include 54 narrow band
        (FWHM {\ensuremath{\sim}} 145 {\r{A}}) and two broader filters
        extending to the UV and the near-infrared, complemented by the
        u, g, r, i SDSS broad band filters. In this miniJPAS survey
        overview paper, we present the miniJPAS data set (images and
        catalogs), as we highlight key aspects and applications of these
        unique spectro-photometric data and describe how to access the
        public data products. The data parameters reach depths of
        mag$_{AB}$ ≃ 22{\ensuremath{-}}23.5 in the 54 narrow band
        filters and up to 24 in the broader filters
        (5{\ensuremath{\sigma}} in a 3″ aperture). The miniJPAS primary
        catalog contains more than 64 000 sources detected in the r band
        and with matched photometry in all other bands. This catalog is
        99\% complete at r = 23.6 (r = 22.7) mag for point-like
        (extended) sources. We show that our photometric redshifts have
        an accuracy better than 1\% for all sources up to r = 22.5, and
        a precision of {\ensuremath{\leq}}0.3\% for a subset consisting
        of about half of the sample. On this basis, we outline several
        scientific applications of our data, including the study of
        spatially-resolved stellar populations of nearby galaxies, the
        analysis of the large scale structure up to z
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.9, and the detection of large numbers of
        clusters and groups. Sub-percent redshift precision can also be
        reached for quasars, allowing for the study of the large-scale
        structure to be pushed to z > 2. The miniJPAS survey
        demonstrates the capability of the J-PAS filter system to
        accurately characterize a broad variety of sources and paves the
        way for the upcoming arrival of J-PAS, which will multiply this
        data by three orders of magnitude.

        perform our analysis in 2 redshift bins lying in the redshift

        By adopting the usual assumption that r$_{h}$ is obtained when
        D$_{2}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2.97, that is, within 1\% of
        D$_{2}$=3, we find the cosmic homogeneity scale with a
        decreasing trend with redshift, and in good agreement with the
        {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM prediction. Our results confirm the
        presence of a homogeneity scale in the spatial distribution of
        quasars as predicted by the fundamental assumptions of the

        supernova (SN Ia) distances provided by the latest SN Ia
        compilation available, namely, the Pantheon compilation. We
        perform a model-independent analysis by selecting low-redshift
        subsamples lying in two redshift intervals, i.e., z

        mapping the directional asymmetry of cosmological parameters
        across the sky, we show that the current SN Ia data favor the
        hypothesis of cosmic isotropy, as the anisotropy found in the
        maps can be mostly ascribed to the nonuniform sky coverage of
        the data rather than an actual cosmological signal. These

        cosmological principle in the low-redshift universe.}",

        homogeneity of the Universe. Testing these assumptions is,
        therefore, crucial to determining if there are deviations from
        the standard cosmological paradigm. In this paper, we use the
        latest type Ia supernova compilations, namely JLA and Union2.1
        to test the cosmological isotropy at low redshift ranges (z <0.1
        ). This is performed through a Bayesian selection analysis, in
        which we compare the standard, isotropic model, with another one
        including a dipole correction due to peculiar velocities. The
        full covariance matrix of SN distance uncertainties are taken
        into account. We find that the JLA sample favors the standard
        model, whilst the Union2.1 results are inconclusive, yet the
        constraints from both compilations are in agreement with
        previous analyses. We conclude that there is no evidence for a
        dipole anisotropy from nearby supernova compilations, albeit
        this test should be greatly improved with the much-improved data
        sets from upcoming cosmological surveys.}",
